# zkpassport_full_proof
This repository implements a flat, multi-file zkPassport-style identity proof system in Noir. All files are stored at a single level (no subfolders) while modeling a complex dApp structure with multiple circuits and commitments. The project demonstrates how a user can generate a composite zk passport that proves several attributes simultaneously
